# Farcaster Cast Data Downloader

This project is a React-based web application that allows users to retrieve their Farcaster cast data by entering their username. The application queries the Dune Analytics API using the provided username, retrieves the cast data, and converts the result into a CSV file that can be downloaded.

## Features
- User inputs a Farcaster username through a form.
- The backend executes a Dune Analytics query to retrieve the cast data associated with the username.
- The results are converted into CSV format.
- The CSV file is automatically downloaded to the user's device.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (with functional components and hooks)
- **Backend**: Next.js API route (`query.js`)
- **API Calls**: Axios for sending HTTP requests to both the Dune API and the custom backend.
- **Dune API**: Uses Duneâ€™s free API key for query execution and fetching results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
- Dune Analytics API Key (Free tier is acceptable).

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Dune API key:
